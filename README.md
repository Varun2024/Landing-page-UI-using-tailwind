# Landing page UI using Tailwind css
This is a project that showcases my skills and learning in web development using Tailwind CSS. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows me to create beautiful and responsive websites without writing custom CSS. I learned how to use Tailwind CSS from the official documentation1 and some online tutorials23.

Features
This project consists of a single-page website that introduces myself, my interests, and my portfolio. The website has the following features:

1. A responsive and modern design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
2. A navbar with a logo and links to different sections of the page.
3. A hero section with a background image, a headline, and a call-to-action button.
4. An about section with a profile picture, a brief introduction, and some icons of the technologies I use.
5. A skills section with a progress bar and a list of the skills I have learned or want to learn.
6. A contact section with a form that allows visitors to send me a message and a footer with some social media links.
